About poetry-publish
====================

Helper to build and upload a project that used poetry to PyPi, with prechecks:

* User must confirm:

    * If ``__version__`` contains 'dev' or 'rc'

    * If git repository is not on ``main`` or ``master``

* Abort publish if git repository contains changes

* Abort if git repository is not up-to-date

* Abort if ``poetry check`` fails

* Abort if ``twine check`` fails

* Abort if git version tag already exists

After a successful upload to PyPi:

* create a git version tag

* git push tag to remote server

Compatible Python Versions (see `tox.ini <https://github.com/jedie/poetry-publish/blob/master/tox.ini>`_ or `.travis.yml <https://github.com/jedie/poetry-publish/blob/master/.travis.yml>`_):

* 3.10, 3.9, 3.8, 3.7, 3.6

example
-------

::

    ~/repos/python-creole$ poetry run publish

    Check if we are on "master" branch:
    	Call: 'git branch --no-color'
    OK

    Set version in "pyproject.toml" to: v1.4.3
    	Call: 'poetry version 1.4.3'

    Bumping version from 1.4.3 to 1.4.3

    check if if git repro is clean:
    	Call: 'git status --porcelain'
    OK

    Run "poetry check":
    OK

    check if pull is needed
    	Call: 'git fetch --all'

    Fordere an von origin
    	Call: 'git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline'
    OK
    	Call: 'git push'

    Everything up-to-date

    Cleanup old builds:
    	remove tree: /home/jens/repos/python-creole/dist

    build but do not upload...
    	Call: 'poetry build'
    Build log file is here: 'publish.log'

    check git tag
    OK

    Upload to PyPi via poetry:
    	Call: 'poetry publish'

     - Uploading python_creole-1.4.3-py3-none-any.whl 100%

    git tag version
    	Call: 'git tag v1.4.3'


    git push tag to server
    	Call: 'git push --tags'

    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To github.com:jedie/python-creole.git
     * [new tag]         v1.4.3 -> v1.4.3

-----------------------
setup usage in projects
-----------------------

Create a publish hook in you project, e.g. create ``your_project/publish.py`` with:

::

    from pathlib import Path

    import your_project
    from poetry_publish.publish import poetry_publish


    def publish():
        poetry_publish(
            package_root=Path(your_project.__file__).parent.parent,
            version=your_project.__version__,
        )

Add this to your poetry ``pyproject.toml``, e.g.:

::

    [tool.poetry.scripts]
    publish = 'your_project:publish'

To publish do this:

::

    ~$ cd your_project
    ~/your_project$ poetry run publish

**Note:** Don't miss the ``run`` ! It's not the same as ``poetry publish``

based on:
`https://github.com/jedie/python-code-snippets/blob/master/CodeSnippets/setup_publish.py <https://github.com/jedie/python-code-snippets/blob/master/CodeSnippets/setup_publish.py>`_

---------
unittests
---------

::

    # clone repository (or use your fork):
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/poetry-publish.git
    ~$ cd poetry-publish

    # install or update poetry:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make install-poetry

    # install poetry-publish via poetry:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make install

    # Run pytest:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make pytest

    # Run pytest via tox with all environments:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox

    # Run pytest via tox with one Python version:
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox-py38
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox-py37
    ~/poetry-publish$ make tox-py36

------------
make targets
------------

::

    ~/poetry-publish$ make
